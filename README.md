# Algebra

This is a small library I write as a parallel of studying algebra
and number theory related to cryptography it's not suitable for production usage
and I doubt it will ever will.

It aims to be literate.

It's a **WIP** and might take time to be finished.

## DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING BUT LEARNING

## Packages

- ```bf``` package implements binary fields
- ```elliptic``` package implements several elliptic curve primitives and
a handful of cryptographic curves.
- ```nt``` package implements number theoretic algorithms and primitives using
arbitrary precision arithmetic
- ```ff``` package implements generic FiniteFields and Field Elements
- ```group``` package implements some custom groups such as Zp,GF(2),GF(8)...
- ```poly``` package implements polynomials over rings
- ```pairing``` package implements bilinear pairings
