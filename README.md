# Algebra

This library I wrote as a parallel of studying algebra and number theory
related to cryptography 0it's not suitable for production usage
and I doubt it will ever will.

The design is quite simple :

- We wrap ```go big.Int``` in an integer type.
- We leverage stdlib implementation and provide our own implementations.
